## Play

To play the game use the arrow keys to move the player on the board.
Your objective is to reach the water as many times as possible without colliding with a ladybug.
Occasionally gems will appear on the top of the game. Reaching the water where the gem is located provides the following bonuses:
	orange gem: doubles points or zeroes score (if score is negative)
	blue gem: slows enemies
	green gem: gives one life (up to 5) or 1000 points.
The game starts with one enemy and one enemy is added each time the player reaches the water, up to 9 enemies.
Good luck and have fun!
