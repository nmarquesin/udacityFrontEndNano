## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Running

To run the game download the whole folder and same somewhere in your computer.
Open the file 'index.html' in your browser.

## Play

To play the game use the arrow keys to move the player on the board.
Your objective is to reach the water as many times as possible without colliding with a ladybug.
Occasionally gems will appear on the top of the game. Reaching the water where the gem is located provides the following bonuses:
	orange gem: doubles points or zeroes score (if score is negative)
	blue gem: slows enemies
	green gem: gives one life (up to 5) or 1000 points.
The game starts with one enemy and one enemy is added each time the player reaches the water, up to 9 enemies.
Good luck and have fun!
